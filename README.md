# React sample app with TypeScript, Less and Webpack

This is a sample React application using Typescript, Less and Webpack. In this application I have configured Typescript, Less and Webpack. This provides the application template and you can play around..!

# To install and run locally
Check out this repo and execute below commands.

1. npm install
